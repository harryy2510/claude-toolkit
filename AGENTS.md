# Agent Toolkit Repository Instructions

## Purpose

This repository is the Agent Toolkit package and marketplace index for Hariom Sharma's agent plugins. It contains the open-source `@harryy/agent-toolkit` CLI, the Rust native core, the Bun TypeScript wrapper, marketplace metadata, and catalog documentation. Plugin implementation lives in the individual plugin repositories.

## Default Execution Mode

Default to speed mode unless the user explicitly asks for deep review, exhaustive testing, E2E validation, release readiness, or careful verification.

- Use repository instructions and existing patterns first.
- Use skills only when they materially reduce risk or the user explicitly requests them.
- For straightforward code changes, do not run skill ceremonies first.
- Use parallel subagents only for clearly independent work when supported and allowed.
- Skip agent-routing unless the user asks for role routing or the task is broad enough to need subagents.
- Do not use Browser Use or Computer Use unless explicitly requested or required for the task.
- Do not run full test suites unless explicitly requested, preparing a commit/PR/release, or touching broad shared behavior.
- Run the smallest targeted check that covers changed behavior.
- Skip checks only for docs-only or trivial edits, and state that checks were skipped.
- Keep tracker/doc updates to concise bullets.
- Timebox investigation to about 5 minutes before making a concrete edit plan.
- Timebox blockers to about 10 minutes, then record the blocker and move on or ask for direction.

## Agent Sync

- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical instruction file for coding agents.
- `.agents/agents.json` is the source of truth for `agents` CLI integration settings.
- Run `agents sync --path .` after changing `.agents/agents.json` when you want to materialize local tool config.
- Do not commit generated tool outputs such as root `CLAUDE.md`, `.codex/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.gemini/`, `.windsurf/`, `.opencode/`, or `.agents/generated/`.
- Do not commit `.agents/intel/`; it is local generated repo intelligence.

## Toolchain

- Use TypeScript for JavaScript-platform code. Do not create `.js` or `.jsx` source files.
- Execute TypeScript with Bun.
- Use Rust for the native performance core.
- Use `oxlint --type-aware --type-check`, not `tsc`.
- Use `oxlint`, not ESLint.
- Use `oxfmt`, not Prettier.
- Use Husky for git hooks. Do not introduce `.githooks` or ad hoc hook folders.
- Any commits must use Conventional Commit format.

## Marketplace Rules

- Keep `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in sync with README install commands.
- Marketplace name is `agent-toolkit`. Use `agent-toolkit` in install and update examples.
- Plugin sources should point at each plugin repo via `git-subdir` and the `plugins/<name>` path.
- Add a plugin entry only after the matching plugin repo has a valid plugin manifest.

## Safety

- Do not add Superpowers docs or planning docs to this public repo.
- Do not run `git push` unless the user explicitly asks in the current message.
- Keep changes scoped to the requested package, marketplace, or documentation surface.

## Agent Toolkit Repo Intelligence

- Before broad exploration, read `.agents/intel/index.md` if it exists.
- Use the task-specific intel files it links to (`overview.md`, `tasks.md`, `graph.md`, `database.md`, and similar) to find the relevant source files before editing.
- `.agents/intel/` is generated and local; do not commit it.
